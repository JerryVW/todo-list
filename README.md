<h2>Summary</h2> 

<p>Building this ToDo project helped me further my knowledge of Javascript. Getting things to appear, disappear and crossing off
the items was a good challenge for me to figure out and to get to work properly.</p> 

<p>I also learned a new CSS layout model that I have not used before called Flexbox. It made working with the layout very easy to do with the few elements that I worked with. I also learned about local storage and how to add and remove items form it.</p>
